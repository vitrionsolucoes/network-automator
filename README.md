# network-automator
 
## To do List
- REFACTOR THE CODE, THE BLADES ARE A TOTAL MESS!
- Implement ICMP checks on device index page, for devices that have IPv4 and/or IPv6 configured;
- Start using SNMP check, could be on device.show page, why not give the option for interface and system graphics already?
- Impement restfull actions for device, device.group, device.vendor and device.model;
- Implement constant/configurable SNMP checks;
- Implement a interface for SSH commands;
- Implement a interface for SNMP write commands;
- Implement a interface for API checks (perhaps could be a better option than SNMP for some devices...);
- Implement triggers;
- Debug why destroy methods are not working;
